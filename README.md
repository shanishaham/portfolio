# Applied Math Undergraduate

## About Me
I am a current second year Applied Math student at UCLA, excited about finding unique ways to supplement the breadth of my coursework with hands on learning experiences. As of now, I am interested in machine learning, data science, quantitative analysis, and mathematical modeling. I am curious about learning more in and around these topics, especially as I progress through my undergraduate career! 

#### Technical Skills: Python, R, C++

## Education
- B.S., Applied Mathematics | UCLA (June 2027)  

## Projects
### Tree-Based Regression in Real Estate Valuation  
- Compared accuracy of four different tree based regression models (Decision Tree, Random Forrest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) when predicting the target variable of house price. I utilized modules from the scikit-learn library and performed various optimization techniques to create the highest scoring model possible. Models built from ensemble learning methods had the best performance, with the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models yielding the strongest accuracy scores of 83.17% and 83.15%, respectively.

### Palmers Penguins Classification   
- Alongside a group of two other students, I evaluated the strengths of three classification methods when applied to the Palmer Penguins dataset. I focused my work on completing a logistic regression model, that was able to achieve a strong accuracy score of 98.4%, which I was able to clearly display in a confusion matrix and in a plot of decision regions.
